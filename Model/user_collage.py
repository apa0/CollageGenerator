#1. Need to load in data from JSON file
#2. This model needs to hold the user's data, right now thats just their recent tracks
#3. From the recent tracks we want to extract things like color, key words in titles, or genre...
#                                                   really it can get as complicated as we want
#4. Has algorithm to match recent track details to 6 photos from wiki art (this is the collage)
#5. Has a function to return the collage to the Controller, which then passes it to the view...
#                                                   (which we dont have right now but thats fine)
